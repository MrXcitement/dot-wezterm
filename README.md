# Personal WezTerm configuration

My global WezTerm config files and folders.

## Install
Use the `install` or `install.ps1` install script to link the configuration files to your home directory.

### To install on a system that has `bash` or similar use:
```sh
$ ./install
```

### To install on a system with `PowerShell` or `pwsh` installed:
Note: on windows run the script from an elevated PowerShell command prompt.

```powershell
> .\install.ps1
```
